# Jaâd, programming learner 

## 👨🏻 This is me

So yeah, this is me. I'm 89 years old, eldest of the family and to put it simple I like *eating*, doing sport, *eating*, learning new things and *eating*.

## 🤹🏻 Most surprising skills

- I can do a pushup on one arm
- I can read arabic but cannot speak it very well
- I can make my thumb **bounce** (I'll show you if you ask)

## ❤️ Things I really really like

- My family, obviously
- Playing games I don't like but with my friends

## 🎯 My goals during BeCode

I would like to get solid fondamentals in coding in order to step up even more and get a job where I could travel, discover people and new projects. 

Also, I would like to improve my capacity to talk in front of bunch of people. (Tech Talk I see you).

## 🧌 Fears ?

Fears you say ? I don't really got ones except maybe spoiling that chance I've got to be here. *But I won't*.

## 🤩 Things I'm thrilled for

- Being able to create my own projects
- Working with my family
- Get a job

## 🤝🏻 Coworking best aspects

- Learning how the others work
- Making people open my boosters in Pokemon TCG Pocket
  > The best part, of course.
- Helping and being helped
